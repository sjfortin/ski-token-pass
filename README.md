Project Title: Soulbound NFT for Independent Ski Resort Community
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to create a Soulbound NFT for the Independent Ski Resort Community that will enable the issuance of a token for accessing a range of ski resorts throughout the year. The NFT will grant access to the ski resort for up to 2 times per year at each resort within the roster of resorts. The project aims to provide a seamless and secure way for the Independent Ski Resort Community to manage access to ski resorts while providing added benefits to token holders.

### Scope of Work:

The project will involve the following tasks:

-   Consultation and Planning: The project team will work with the Independent Ski Resort Community to understand their requirements and develop a plan for the NFT. This will include determining the number of resorts that will be included in the roster and the number of times that token holders will be able to access each resort.
-   NFT Development: The project team will develop the Soulbound NFT that will be used to grant access to the ski resorts. The NFT will be based on a blockchain technology and will be secure and tamper-proof.
-   Smart Contract Development: The project team will develop the smart contract that will manage the issuance and transfer of the NFTs. The smart contract will ensure that only valid NFTs are accepted for access to the ski resorts.
-   Website Development: The project team will develop a website that will allow users to purchase and manage their NFTs. The website will be user-friendly and will include features such as a dashboard for managing NFTs and a marketplace for buying and selling NFTs.
-   Testing and Deployment: The project team will conduct thorough testing of the NFT and the smart contract to ensure that they are functioning correctly. Once testing is complete, the NFT and smart contract will be deployed to the blockchain.
-   Maintenance and Support: The project team will provide ongoing maintenance and support for the NFT and the smart contract. This will include bug fixes, security updates, and technical support for users.
